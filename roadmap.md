# Roadmap

## Week 1

### Non-Tech
- [ ] Break the Ice! Form groups, get to know your teammates.
- [ ] What would each of you like to contribute in Week 1.
- [ ] Ideate. Think of features you would like to add.
- [ ] Log your progress. Create a shared progress tracker(Notion,Linear or a README).

### Technical
- [x] Learn fundamentals of Git and VCS
- [ ] Getting Python fundamentals right.
    - [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Get confortable with basics of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/guides/docker-overview/)
- [ ] Machine Learning Fundamentals
    - [ ] How to Clean your data
    - [ ] How to Preprocess data
    - [ ] Process of training models
        - [ ] Weights and biases
        - [ ] Backpropagation
        - [ ] [Neural Nets from Scratch](https://prathameshdevadiga.vercel.app/posts/nnfs/)
    - [ ] Explore TensorflowHub and HuggingFace
        - [ ] Explore pretrained models.
        - [ ] Explore API endpoints that are provided.
- [ ] Play around with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)/[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).
- [ ] TASK: Configuration Parsing and basic working prototype.

## Week 2
Train a sentiment analysis model.(This is a topic we chose but you're free to choose your own).
- [ ] Find a good dataset.
- [ ] Define a good config file format.(The target is to make modelforge *as* modular as possible).
    - [ ] Refer to the sample config file in `examples/config.yml`.
- [ ] Make modelforge preprocess this data.
    - [ ] Hint/Tip: Make heavy use of OOP so you don't regret later.
- [ ] Train the model!
- [ ] Document your progress!
